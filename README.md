# Portfolio
If you're a hiring manager please refer to this repo, Thank you.

This repo currently displays some of the Python projects I'm working on currently and had worked on it the past.
I have a few more little projects I did that are available only locally on my personal computer, if interested, I'll gladly provide them.
